# netrunner-collection
Show all cards in a netrunnerdb decklist

## Usage
First create a public decklist on www.netrunnerdb.com and get the deckid from the url. 
The currently featured deck has the url http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/26062/iain-s-creepy-sleepover and thus the id is 26062.

Now run `python netrunner-collection.py --deckid 26062` and then open the new file `collection.html`.
